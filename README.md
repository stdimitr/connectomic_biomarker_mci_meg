CONNECTOMIC BIOMARKER FOR MCI


A paper is under revision in Frontiers in Neuroscience presenting an extreme search of optimal design of connectomic biomarker for MCI
with MEG source-reconstructed activity.
We will share for the very first time MEG recordings from MCI subjects and also a pipeline that deals with:

1. Source reconstruction
2. 2 ROI representation: PCA - CENTROID
3. 3 connectivity estimators : PLV,iPLV, Corr Env
4. Intra and inter-frequency coupling
5. Single-Layer vs Multi-layer Brain Networks
6.Edge-based classification performance
7. Tensorial treatment of single or multi-layer brain network
